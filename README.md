### I'm a software engineer dedicated to making open-source contributions more accessible, crafting technology that empowers people, and fostering vibrant communities. I thrive working with technologies like Django, Python, APIs, and Markup. 
### During the late 2024 (December), I was among those selected for the fully-funded prestigous software development bootcamp by Hyperiondev where I was exposed to different software developmental tools that had horned my skills and made me an excellent programmer.
